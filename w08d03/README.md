# W08D03 - End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### To Do
- [x] Cypress > Jest
- [x] Install and Configure Cypress
- [x] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### E2E Testing
* testing our app the way a user would
* these are the user stories

### Jest vs Cypress
* Jest
  * command line
  * test code is written in the src
  * unit testing /integration testing
  * incredibly cheap!

* Cypress
  * browser-based
  * test code is external to src
  * e2e testing
  * so expensive!!!
